                            My dear Ichu, from the moment I met you, my world has been brighter, fuller, and more complete. Your laughter is like music to my ears, your smile a beacon of joy that lights up even the darkest of days. With each passing moment, my love for you only grows stronger, deeper, and more unshakeable. Ichu, will you do me the great honor of being mine, of joining me on this incredible journey called life, hand in hand, heart to heart? I can't imagine a future without you by my side, and I promise to cherish and love you for all eternity. Let's walk this path together, creating memories, overcoming challenges, and celebrating each moment as we build a life filled with love, laughter, and endless happiness. Will you be my partner in all things, my love, my Ichu?
